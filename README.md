### MoodMap's Mission
**Data tracking for Clinicians and Clients.**

Providing data directly to your clinician and yourself to show **real-time progress**.

> **The Problem:**
> 
> If you've been to a clinician — whether for physical or mental health — you're often left alone for long periods between checkups. After months, you're asked: *"How do you feel?"* or *"Any improvements?"*
>
> This is an **"on the spot"** question. Patients describe how they *think* they've progressed, which is often inaccurate. This lack of objective data can lead to incorrect medication, inefficient follow-ups, and long-term consequences.

### Use Case

1. **Diagnosis:** A client is diagnosed with depression.
2. **Prescription:** The clinician prescribes anti-depressants for 3 months.
3. **The Problem:** Client takes the medication but has no system for logging daily moods or side effects.
4. **The Review:** After 3 months, the doctor asks *"How has it been?"*.
5. **The Error:** The client, relying on memory, says *"It's been alright"*, forgetting side effects or "lows" that occurred weeks ago.
6. **Result:** The clinician extends the prescription based on incomplete information, even though the client might still be clinically depressed or suffering side effects.

**With MoodMap** - the clinician and the program track - if something is off track in real-time. It provides:
*   ✅ **Objective Data:** No more guessing during reviews.
*   ✅ **Suggested Actions:** Automated insights based on trends.
*   ✅ **Training Schedules:** Exercises specified by your clinician.
*   ✅ **Better help:** Providing the right solution to the client.

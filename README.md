### MoodMap's Mission
**Data tracking for Clinicians and Clients.**

Providing data directly to your clinician and yourself to show **real-time progress**.

<blockquote style="background-color:#f5f5f5; color:#333; padding:10px; border-left:5px solid #FF0000;">
<strong>The Problem:</strong><br>
If you've been to a clinician — whether for physical or mental health — you're often left alone for long periods between checkups. After months, you're asked: <em>"How do you feel?"</em> or <em>"Any improvements?"</em>
<br><br>
This is an <strong>"on the spot"</strong> question. Patients describe how they <em>think</em> they've progressed, which is often inaccurate. This lack of objective data can lead to incorrect medication, inefficient follow-ups, and long-term consequences.

### Use Case

1. **Diagnosis:** A client is diagnosed with depression.
2. **Prescription:** The clinician prescribes anti-depressants for 3 months.
3. **The Problem:** Client takes the medication but has no system for logging daily moods or side effects.
4. **The Review:** After 3 months, the doctor asks *"How has it been?" and static questions as such*.
5. **The Error:** The client, relying on memory, says *"It's been alright"*, forgetting side effects or "lows" that occurred weeks ago.
6. **Result:** The clinician extends the prescription based on incomplete information, even though the client might still be clinically depressed or suffering side effects.

**With MoodMap** - the clinician and the program track - if something is off track in real-time. It provides:
*   ✅ **Objective Data:** No more guessing during reviews.
*   ✅ **Suggested Actions:** Automated insights based on trends.
*   ✅ **Training Schedules:** Exercises specified by your clinician.
*   ✅ **Better help:** Providing the right solution to the client.

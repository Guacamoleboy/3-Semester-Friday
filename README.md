    Data tracking for Clinicians and Clients.

  $\color{#999999}\large{\textbf{If you've been to a clinician - whether it's physic or mental - you're left alone for a long period of time}}$
  $\color{#999999}\large{\textbf{untill your next checkup. After a few months you're at a check up and they ask you}}$ 
  $\color{#999999}\large{\textbf{After a few months you're at a check up and they ask you "How do you feel..?" or "Any improvements in movement..?" etc.}}$  
    This is a "on the spot" question - meaning - the person has to describe how they THINK the progress has went. 
    This isn't optimal and often causes wrong medication, follow ups, and consequences for the individual person.

<h3>$\color{#392580}\large{\textbf{Use Case}}$</h3>

<p>
  $\color{#999999}\large{\textbf{
  - 1) A client is diagnosed with Depression.
  }}$
  <br>
  - 2) The clinician tells the Client to take anti-depressants for 3 months.
  <br>
  - 3) Client takes the medication and after 3 months is set for a review.
  <br>
  - 4) Client has no logging, data, side effect schema or anything that he - or the clinician - can use to see how the actual progress has been
  <br>
  - 5) Client is at review and the doctor asks "How has it been..?". Client doesn't really know other than maybe feeling slightly better. Client says it's been alright - but in fact the client isn't well.
  <br>
  - 6) Clinician tells the client to keep using the anti-depressants for another 3 months.
  <br><br>
  Now.. What's the issue?
  <br>
  Client doesn't really "know" the progress, pre and post medication statements. Client might feel better - but not up to par. Clinician thinks everything's fine. In fact the Client still is depressed. Just not as much as before.
  <br>
  Client might even have Side Effects that the Client has forgotten to mention on the day. Or maybe didn't notice as Side Effects as they went away after some time.
  <br><br>
  With MoodMap the clinician and the program itself is able to track if something is off track. This provides information to the clinician and to the client. MoodMap will provide suggested actions.
  <br>
  MoodMap also provides Training Schedules and exercises for the user to complete over a given timeline specified by the Clinician.
